  <b>Liz's Note's</b>

<p>I learned the basic understanding of how the internet works.  Understanding how users,
computers, servers, http; and the internet all fit together. I learned how to use HTML tags to create a simple 
HTML document </p> 

<p><b>HTML</b> stands for Hypertext Markup Language.  This is the basis for everything on the web.
All kinds of files can be found on the web.  The four major pieces are:<br><br> HTTP<br>
Servers<br> Internet, and<br> Browser</p>

In addition, HTML is is made up of:
<br><br>text content
<br>markup
<br>references to other documents
<br>and links on other pages
</p>

<p><b>Learning about HTML Structure and Tags - How They Work</b></p>

<p>I learned that that there is such a thing as a bold  tag, this is a tag that allows you to bold 
your content.  This is simply done with a <b>"b"</b> tag.</p>

<p>I also learned that there is an emphasis tag and how this tag works.  This is called an
<b>"em"</b> tag, and it will italicize content.  <em>This phrase should now look italic since
I am using the <b>"em"</b>tag.</em>  Check out how I also learned to <b><em>bold and italicize 
at the same time. In addition, if I forget to out an "em" tag, everything else after 
the tag remains italicized.</em></b></p>

<p><b>Attributes</b></p>  

<p>Attributes relate to a value.  These are also called anchors which means essentially
  they are links within your content.  In order to remember all of these different kinds of tags 
  have to have some good <a href="www.notetakinghelp.com">notetaking</a> skills.</p>

<p>In addition, another type of anchor can be an image such as</p>

<p/>

<p>Even though you put text in multiple lines when you render in html it renders all on a single 
line.  This is because in HTML all white space (new lines, tabs) all turn into a single
space. to force our html to have lines we use the "br" tag and it is a void tag.  You put 
this anywhere you want there to appear multiple lines.</p>

<p>Another way of doing line breaks is to use the "p" tag, this is not a void tag, this would 
have a closing tag and an opening tage.  This will render as one paragraph.</p> 

<p>When you enter a tag and have spaces and nothing happens this is called inline, the br tag
is an inline tag.  Unlike the p tag this tag creates an invisible box around text.  Inline 
elements just have texts vs. the block is that the block can have width and height.</p> 

<p>Inline elements are b, em, img at this point the only block element is the p tag.</p>

<p><b>Span and Div</b></p>

<p>These are both normal elements and they can both have content, the only difference is that 
span is inline and div is block.</p>

<p>CSS means adding styles to your documents such as changin ways your text can look.</p> 

<p><b>The structure of An HTML document</b></p> 

<p>An actual HTML document has the doc type, shows what kind of html the document is.  Then 
there is a tag an opening and and a closing, then there is the head, which contains 
metadata and other random things.  The title appears in the top of the browsser tab,
then there is the body tab which is the content of the document.</p> 

<p>Another view is that an HTML document has a head section, then there is a body section, the
things you see on the screen.</p>
